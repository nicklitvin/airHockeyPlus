NOTES
If right click on browser top, move doesn't reset
server sends one game frame after game end
blue shadow for orange move, illusion?
game starts if unready leaves and rest are ready
if lone player goes to other game #, no return
if lone player refresh lobby, no return
change to PORT = 80 when external IP

TODO
make previous collision more specific to optimize
find 2 nearest collisions in case 1st is a repeat of first cause touching is collision
when is collision? check for previous collision
testcollisionprocedure if repeat collision, can be wall again in a moment.

hold previousCollision in Game object
how to find tangent line when ball and player radii are diff, shouldnt matter?
collision can increase speed > speed limit
have ball be in contact list gameLobby
contacts should include ball
ball passing through players
ball needs stronger impulse
spread functions to other files
store users instead of userIds

FOR LATER
colorblind feature
movement multiplier based on time passed (accuracy)
set timer to delete last ball toucher 
losers advantage is size
make how to play page w/ instructions + navigate site
owner kick players & close room party owner power
make mobile version on browser
ballImpulse logic bad, need to know player move, fine if <15players
maintenance to remove inactive users (who forgot about tab)
return to game if user's browser closed all tabs
3+ teams (corner goals)
close room power in lobby

separate game.js(canvas stuff) from index.js
specify error using cookies, roomcontrol save cookie w/ error
