isCollisionPossible: p1.magnitude > p2.magnitude + ROUNDING_ERROR, may cause overlap

TODO
V0.1.21 refactoring (tests, game independent)
V0.1.22 function cleanup
make Tests actual lobbies

make all functions usegetobjectbyId()
 (gameControl,players,physics,tests)
timePassed for collision hold in game

V0.2.X customization (modes, instructions, kicking players)

combine x,y and dx,dy into vector, transition to vectors
make ballIds part of game
default fix if all fails for collision control
if overlap, pusher may still be faster, what is effect?
optimize calculations
scorers not counting properly?

FOR LATER
no friction mode
multiple balls, lobby.balls = [Ball,Ball], balls need to have id
colorblind feature
movement multiplier based on time passed (accuracy)
set timer to delete last ball toucher 
losers advantage is size
make how to play page w/ instructions + navigate site
make mobile version on browser
maintenance to remove inactive users (who forgot about tab)
3+ teams (corner goals)
close room power in lobby
configuration contains all preset values {x:?,y:?,radius:? ...}
separate game.js(canvas stuff) from index.js
specify error using cookies, roomcontrol save cookie w/ error
lobby button appearance changes when ready (green/red)
name change limit per minute
send survey to players after game (game quality, site in general)
