isCollisionPossible: p1.magnitude > p2.magnitude + ROUNDING_ERROR, may cause overlap
remove strict equal when website is setup, log mistakes

player1 cant choose blue side sometimes?
-0 may affect math.sign
if overlap, pusher may still be faster, what is effect?
make functions public and private, commentate
socket.emit not work when debugging 1 step at time
games being deleted when run with tests bug
ball collision at certain angle => infinite collisions, probably rounding error

TODO
V0.2.X customization

set timeout uses game version that hasn't ended yet bug
send game happens after endgame sent, but userIds not changed for game, so can't find user who left
random disconnect signal after everyone left

why refresh rate affect move? less is fast, make move depend on timeDiff
dont send mouse coordinates if using keyboard
set position should take in vector
wait for all users to connect to game before actually starting

mobile control
close room power in lobby
name change limit per minute
specify error using cookies, roomcontrol save cookie w/ error
lobby button appearance changes when ready (green/red)
no friction mode
multiple balls, lobby.balls = [Ball,Ball], balls need to have id
many teams and a moving goal
balls are on black team
movement multiplier based on time passed (accuracy)
set timer to delete last ball toucher 
losers advantage is size
make how to play page w/ instructions + navigate site
maintenance to remove inactive users (who forgot about tab)

configuration contains all preset values {x:?,y:?,radius:? ...}
separate game.js(canvas stuff) from index.js
send survey to players after game (game quality, site in general)
configuration dictionary (for player speed limit...)
consider no bounce if player pushing ball into wall?
Have Game be an obejct of Room, rename lobby as room, move room functions from roomControl
save move command on server if player lags
