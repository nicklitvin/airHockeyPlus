isCollisionPossible: p1.magnitude > p2.magnitude + ROUNDING_ERROR, may cause overlap

TODO
split game into time manager, info manager, collision manager
Tests are functional
Vector to transition
Function cleanup
configuration dictionary (for player speed limit...)

V0.2.X customization (modes, instructions, kicking players)

timePassed for collision hold in game
have ball remember starting position, no need to recalculate
game countdown takes away from game time
set player position using class and vector
combine x,y and dx,dy into vector, transition to vectors
make ballIds part of game
default fix if all fails for collision control
if overlap, pusher may still be faster, what is effect?
optimize calculations
make Game1Control an instance part of the room?

FOR LATER
no friction mode
multiple balls, lobby.balls = [Ball,Ball], balls need to have id
colorblind feature
movement multiplier based on time passed (accuracy)
set timer to delete last ball toucher 
losers advantage is size
make how to play page w/ instructions + navigate site
make mobile version on browser
maintenance to remove inactive users (who forgot about tab)
3+ teams (corner goals)
close room power in lobby
configuration contains all preset values {x:?,y:?,radius:? ...}
separate game.js(canvas stuff) from index.js
specify error using cookies, roomcontrol save cookie w/ error
lobby button appearance changes when ready (green/red)
name change limit per minute
send survey to players after game (game quality, site in general)
