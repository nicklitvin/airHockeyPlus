NOTES
If right click on browser top, move doesn't reset
server sends one game frame after game end?
blue shadow for orange move, illusion?
game starts if unready leaves and rest are ready
if lone player goes to other game #, no return
if lone player refresh lobby, no return
change to PORT = 80 when external IP
goals currently disabled

isCollisionPossible: p1.magnitude > p2.magnitude + ROUNDING_ERROR, may cause overlap
wall - p1 - ball <- p2 collision crashes game (Maximum call stack size exceeded)

TODO
Tests are functional
objects remember starting position
make functions public and private, commentate
sending info simplify
goals independent
split game into time manager, info manager, collision manager
Function cleanup
configuration dictionary (for player speed limit...)
game countdown takes away from game time
make ballIds part of game
default fix if all fails for collision control
if overlap, pusher may still be faster, what is effect?
optimize calculations

FOR LATER
V0.2.X customization (modes, instructions, kicking players)
mouse control
mobile control
colorblind feature
close room power in lobby
name change limit per minute
specify error using cookies, roomcontrol save cookie w/ error
lobby button appearance changes when ready (green/red)
no friction mode
multiple balls, lobby.balls = [Ball,Ball], balls need to have id
movement multiplier based on time passed (accuracy)
set timer to delete last ball toucher 
losers advantage is size
make how to play page w/ instructions + navigate site
maintenance to remove inactive users (who forgot about tab)
3+ teams (corner goals)
configuration contains all preset values {x:?,y:?,radius:? ...}
separate game.js(canvas stuff) from index.js
send survey to players after game (game quality, site in general)
