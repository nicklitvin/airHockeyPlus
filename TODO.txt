    check if owner is changing game not hacker
bug: rightclicking in game messes up move 
dont generate entire player list repeatedly
transition to jQuery
closeRoom power to joiners in lobby
disable cornering of ball
only impulse off walls if in contact with wall, maybe launch direction ui

glitch: bounce doesn't always go all the way to the bot wall, works for others
create more accuracte collision mechanic
reduce radius depending on player count
create timer for impulse
fluid motion, have move stored on server in players{}
if blocked cookies, special error
separate game.js(canvas stuff) from index.js

specify error using cookies, roomcontrol save cookie w/ error
owner kick players, make owner buttons

if owner alone refreshes, error cause lobby gets deleted
send survey to players after game (game quality, site in general)
